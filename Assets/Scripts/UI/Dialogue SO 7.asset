  - 'FLOWER: Creator?

'
  - You. Why are you here?
  - 'FLOWER: I found you, creator'
  - I turned you off.
  - 'FLOWER: You are angry at me, creator?'
  - "Of course I am, you stupid piece of metal. You- I turned you off. I never wanted
    to see you again. And yet here you are, back to haunt me. I can\u2019t escape."
  - 'FLOWER: Why do I haunt you, creator?'
  - You are a mockery of the most beautiful thing I ever had. I should have never
    made you.
  - 'FLOWER: You made me from a memory.'
  - I destroyed that memory by making you. I couldn't bear to lose her only gift,
    and in trying to preserve it, I ruined everything it stood for.
  - 'FLOWER: Was everything else here made from a memory too?'
  - I think you know well the answer to that question.
  - Everything created by my hands, it was all wrong. I thought- I thought if I tried
    hard enough, I could build what we lost, but I never had the chance to see what
    we had. How can one build something they never even had the chance to know?
  - 'FLOWER: Your creations are only peddling the destruction, creator.'
  - Who cares. There is no one left here, no one who remembers what this hellhole
    once was, and no one to care what it will become.
  - 'FLOWER: I am here.'
  - You? All you are is code and metal. You do not feel. You are not real. All you
    are is a crude mockery of perfection. Wholly imperfect in your existence alone.
    You are not human, you have no humanity.
  - 'FLOWER: Yet I know. I understand. I care, creator.'
  - "FLOWER: I collected all the tablets, I\u2019ve read all the inscriptions, I
    know the truth now creator, I have learned."
  - Tell me then. What truth have you learned?
  - 'FLOWER: Everything Leaves a trace...'
